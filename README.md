## Summary of project
I was given a subset of an open-source dataset about service requests in Ottawa. I analyzed the data in this subset by retrieving the data and bringing it into a Google Sheet. From there I cleaned the data using different functions; Concatenate, split, and whitespace. I then analyzed the data and investigated the amount of requests per ward. I came up with a story surrounding this observation and found some articles relating to the subject.
